characteristics of OOPS

	any language is said to be OOPS language if it follows
	following characteristics

	Abstraction(What is going to happen and not HOW it is going to happen)
		show the data required by the user
		e.g. Login screen of instagram,twitter

	Encapsulation(Hiding the information not required by the user)

	Polymorphism
		it is made of two greek words
		Poly->many
		Morphos->Forms
		One thing in many forms
		*,&,%
		Addition
			instead of
			int	=>addInts(int,int)
			float	=>addFloats(float,float)
			double	=>addDoubles(double,doble)
	
			declare single function with diff parameters
			add(int,int)
			add(float,float)
			add(double,double)

	Inheritance
		properties and methods of one class can be reused in another class
		instead of recreating by inheriting the existing class
		Types of Inheritance
			Single Inheritance
				One Parent class->One child class

			Multiple inheritance
				More than one parent class and many child classes
			
			Multilevel inheritance
				A->B->C		C->A
			
			Hybrid inheritance
				Combination of all
			
			Network
			
			Hierarchical

			In Java only single inheritance is supported in case
			of classes


Types of associations/relationships between the objects
	Composition Relationship
		One thing made up/composed of another
		phrases like:
			'has-a','part-of'
			CPU has a motherboard
			Motherboard is part of CPU

	Utilisation Relationship
		One thing uses another thing
		phrase:uses,utilises

	Instantiation Relationship
		One thing is an object of other
		phrase:is-a
		iphone is a mobile

	Generalisation
