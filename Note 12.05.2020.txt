Types of inheritance
	single inheritance
	Multiple inheritance
	Multi-level inheritance

	Java supports only single inheritance in case of classes

limitations of inheritance
	inheritance takes place from parent to child and not vice-a-versa
	Though child class is member of parent class 
	it cannot access private members of parent

Abstract classes
	classes which have abstract and non abstract methods
	methods without body are called as abstract methods
	hence abstract classes are considered as incomplete classes
	and we need to inherit abstract classes in order to implement methods from it
	as it is considered as incomplete class we cannot create object of abstract class
