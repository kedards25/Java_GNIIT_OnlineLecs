OOPS
	classes and objects

	objects
		Any real world entity around us 
		properties and behavior
		
		object of particular category has same properties
		Real world	OOPS		programatic
		properties	state		variables
		functionality	Behavior	Methods/Functions
		unique thing	identity	constants

		Two objects can have same state and behavior but will never 
		have same identity

		objects of two classes communicate with each other using messages
		in response to the message given by one object,other object performs
		some action and this action is called as method

	classes
		collection of objects with same state and behavior
		or objects belonging to particular class exhibit all the state
		and behavior of the given class

Advantages of OOPS
	Realistic Modelling
		connects to real world thus making problem 
		solving eay
	Reusability
		Reuse the code whenever and wherever required
	Modularity
		Division of problem statement in small problem modules
		least dependancy
	Resilience/Flexibility to change
		To make a small change we need not to rewrite the whole code
	Information Hiding
		Hiding the unneccessary information from the user
