Java is not only a language but a technology
Java is platform independant because
java program->jvm->converts your code in machine language(Binary language)
->compiled code then runs on your OS

which application is responsible for converting your code in machine language??
Compiler	->converts your code as whole
interpreter	->converts your code line by line

java is the language which uses compiler and interpreter both
	.java file gets converted to bytecode (.class) using compiler
	.class file further gets interpreted by JIT(Just In Time Compiler) 

instead of setting path everytime we launch command prompt(cmd)
we can set path globally by using environment variables

WAP to convert given in Kilometers to meters
