Types of If..Else

nested if	//executes when first condition is true

in case of normal or conditional execution
	we will get only one output in one execution
	if we want to get more than one o/p in single execution then
	we should implement loop

loops help to run given block of code for n number of times
to execute loop we need to implement an iterator

	iterator helps you to iterate the loop
	iterator
		starting value
		end value
		incr/decr

Types of Loop
	while
	do..while
	for
