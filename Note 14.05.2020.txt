interfaces help us to implement multiple/multi-level inheritance
methods in interface are public abstract by default=>methods will describe what will happen and 
						not how it will happen
we cannot declare variables in an interface but constants can be defined

int num//not allowed in interface
int NUM=8//allowed in interface

abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods
whereas interface will have abstract methods only

in order to inherit an interface the keyword is 'implements'
