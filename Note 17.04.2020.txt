Loops help us to iterate given block of code for given number of times

to iterate loop we should use an iterator
you can relate the iterator to the elavator in the society
it is used to take people up and down

if you are standing on ground floor and you want to go on 7th floor
what will be starting point and the ending point?

will the elavator directly go to 7th floor or will go up gradually?

so these are the three steps involved in iterator
initial value
limit
incr/decr

iterator has to be provided with three parameters
initial value
condition
incr/decr

sometimes we can use iterator itself as a process
to implement iteration we have three features
while
do..while
tell me when to use do..while??
	we can use do..while when I want to put condition on calculated value
	can anyone explain the said line?
	int a,b,c;
	a=5;
	b=7;
	I want to put condition on c but c is result of addition
	do
	{
		c=a+b;
	}while(c<100)

is this clear??


We are consuming 3 lines to implement loop
which may add up to lenghy code
hence in order to make the loop compact we use for loop
in which all the three steps are given in one line
for

Those who know the concept of break and continue predict 
the o/p
