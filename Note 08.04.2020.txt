Operator operates on variables
in terms of operators ,variables are called as operands

a+b
+ =>operator
a,b=>operands

Assignment
=
assignment is done from right to left
x=7

Arithmatic Operators
	+,-,*,/,%
	% =>mod->modulus
	remainder after division->can be used to check if 
	given number is divisible by other or not

	5/2=2
	5%2=1


Arithmatic Assignment Operator
Arithmatic is performed on the variable and value is stored
back in same variable	

a=5
+=	a+=5	a=a+5	a=10
-=	a-=5	a=a-5	a=5 
*=	a*=5	a=a*5	a=25
/=	a/=5	a=a/5	a=5
%=	a%=5	a=a%5	a=0


Conditional Operators
<,>,<=,>=,==,!=

a=7
a==8	=>false
a!=9	=>True

Boolean value

Logical Operator
	AND,OR,NOT

and(&&)

C1	C2	Res
T	T	T
T	F	F
F	T	F
F	F	F


OR(||)

C1 	C2	Res
T	T	T
T	F	T
F	T	T
F	F	F

NOT(!)
C1	Res
T	F
F	T

x=7
!(x==10)
!(x!=15)

Unary Operators
operators that operate on single variable
++
--
a=5
a++	a=6
a-- 	a=5

x=5	y=8
x=y++
x=? 	y=?

x=5	y=8
x=++y
x=? 	y=?
